Set the WooCommerce payment gateway in URLs sent to customers.

== Description ==

Add `?payment_gateway=preferred_gateway_id` to links in emails you send to your customers, and when they reach the
checkout, that will be the selected payment gateway.

A WordPress filter exists so the text in the URL can be set to whatever you prefer.

[Technical detail is on GitHub](github.com/brianhenryie/bh-wc-set-gateway-by-url).
